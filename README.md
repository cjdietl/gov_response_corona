# Extracting Government Reactions against the Covid Pandemic from News Feeds
2020 I participated in the Hackathon [#wirvsvirus](https://wirvsvirus.org/) sponsered by the German government to find solutions combatting the Covid outbreak or to make life in the lockdown phase easier. I was categorized as a 'Mentor', so I was acting as an expert to be available for any kind of questions. Not surprisingly, there were not that many questions for a solid state physicist. So I got bored and took matter in my own hands. With only a half a day left, I tried to find a way to automatically extract dates for various actions of governments around the world, which might be helpful to correlate data regarding infected persons with the government actions.
